## Chapter 4 Loops

Loops are statements that repeat other statements (called the action). For loops are generally  used as counted loops, in which the number of repetitions is specified ahead of time. In Python,  for loops are frequently used to perform the same operation(s) on everything stored in a  sequence. While loops are conditional loops, which repeat statements as long as an expression  is True, or until something happens. Nested loops will also be covered; with nested loops, one  loop is in the action of another.

### 4.1 For loops
#### 4.1.1 Loops using range

For loops are used to repeat other statements (called the action) a specified number of times.

The easiest way to specify how many times is to use the range function. The range function  generates a sequence of numbers. Called with an integer n, range(n) creates a sequence of n integers. By using an iterator variable and the in operator along with the range function, we  can specify how many times to repeat an action. The general form to specify repeating an  action n times is:

```python
for itervar in range(n):
    action
# rest of code
```

This says to repeat the action n times. The iterator variable iterates through all of the numbers  generated by the range function, and for each value of the iterator variable, the action is  executed. The action can be any number of valid statements. All of the statements in the action  must be indented to the same level (typically 4 spaces). For historical reasons, the iterator  variable (itervar) is frequently named i.

For example, the following for loop specifies repeating the action of printing a single ‘!’ 5 times.

```python
for i in range(5): 
 print('!', end='') 
print('\nOK')
```

This produces the output:

```python
!!!!!
OK
```

The iterator variable i iterates through the 5 values produced by the range function, and for  each of those five values it prints a single exclamation point, on the same line. Specifying end =  ‘ ’ keeps all of the exclamation points on the same line, with nothing printed in between them.  After the loop, printing the newline character moves down to the next line, where ‘OK’ is  printed.

Note that in this example, the iterator variable i was not used in the action; it simply specified  how many times to execute the action. In some cases, however, using the value of the iterator  variable in the action is desired.

The sequence that is produced by range begins with 0, and ends at n-1. For example, range(4)  creates a sequence of 4 integers: 0, 1, 2, 3.

The following loop prints the integers 0 to 3 in a column, and then ‘OK’ after the loop.

```python
for i in range(4): 
 print(i) 
print('OK')
```

```python
0
1
2
3
OK
```

In this example, the iterator variable i iterates through the values in the sequence produced by  the range function. For every value of the iterator variable, the action is executed. The action  in this case was to print the value of i (and the newline character, which print does by default).  So, when i had the value 0, 0 was printed. Then, the iterator variable i got the value of 1, and 1
was printed. Then, i got the value of 2 and 2 was printed. Then, i got the value of 3 and 3 was  printed. Once the iterator variable has iterated through all of the values in the sequence, the  loop is over. Once the action was repeated 4 times, for every value in the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3,  the next statement in the code after the loop was executed, which printed ‘OK’.

The following prints the integers 0 to 2, each of which is followed by a colon, space, and ‘!’.

```python
for num in range(3):
    print(f'{num}: !')
```
```python
0: !
1: !
2: !
```

Although frequently named i, the iterator variable can have any name. In this case, the iterator  variable num iterated through the values 0, 1, and 2. The action that was executed for each  value of num was to print num in a formatted line including a colon and exclamation mark.

So, again, sometimes the iterator variable is just used to specify how many times to repeat an  action, as in:

```python
for i in range(3):  
    print('*')
```
```python
*
*
*
```

Sometimes the value of the iterator variable is used in the action, as in:

```python
for i in range(3): 
 print(i)
```
```python
0
1
2
```

#### 4.1.2 Looping through sequences

A for loop can be used in Python to iterate through the items in any sequence, and perform the  same action for each one. The general form is

```python
for itervar in sequence:
    action
# rest of code
```

There is a variable, itervar, that iterates through all of the items in the sequence in order. For  each item, the action is executed.

The following loops through all of the items in the list somenums and prints each in a sentence.

```python
somenums = [4, 33, 11] 
for n in somenums: 
 print('The number is', n)
```

```python
The number is 4
The number is 33
The number is 11
```

At the beginning of the loop, the iterator variable n gets the value of the first number in the list,  which is 4, so the action prints ‘The number is 4’. Then, after the action has been executed in its  entirety (in this case, it is just one statement), the iterator variable gets the next number in the  list, 33. This is printed, and then n gets the value 11, which is printed. Once the action has been  executed for all of the numbers in the list, the loop ends.

After the loop, the iterator variable n stores the last item from the list.

```python
somenums = [4, 33, 11] 
for n in somenums: 
 print('The number is', n) print('n is ', n)
```
```python
The number is 4
The number is 33
The number is 11
n is 11
```

The list does not need to be stored in a variable. The following will produce identical results.

```python
for n in [4, 33, 11]: 
 print('The number is', n) print('n is ', n)
```
```python
The number is 4
The number is 33
The number is 11
n is 11
```

Another example illustrates looping through a list that stores different types of items, and  displaying the type of each:

```python
mixedlist = [33, 'hi', False]
for m in mixedlist: 
 print(type(m))
```
```python
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'bool'>
```

Since strings are sequences, for loops can iterate through the characters in a string. For  example, the following prints each character in a string followed by a space:

```python
myword = 'hello' 
for c in myword: 
 print(c, end = ' ') print()
```
```
h e l l o
```

The last print() statement is used to move down to the next line (to print a newline).
Using the choice function, the following code uses a for loop to repeat the process of choosing  a random item from a list 8 times, and prints each one.

```python
from random import choice 
numlist = [4, 52, 33, 11, -3] 
for n in range(8): 
 print(choice(numlist))
```
```
4
11
52
33
52
-3
33
11
```

To print 5 random integers in the range from 0 to 99 inclusive, we can first create a list and then  as above choose random items from the list.

```python
from random import choice 
nums = list(range(100)) 
for n in range(5): 
 print(choice(nums))
```
```
10
42
60
54
12
```

This also works with just the range function; the list is not necessary.
```python
from random import choice 
nums = range(100) 
for n in range(5): 
 print(choice(nums))
```
```
0
41
1
13
71
```
#### 4.1.3 Calculating Running Sums

A useful application of a loop is to calculate a running sum. A running sum typically starts at 0,  and then numbers are added to the sum one at a time. For example, the sum 0+1+2+3+4+5  would start at 0, then 0+1 which is 1, then 1+2 which is 3, then 3 + 3 which is 6, then 6 + 4  which is 10 and finally 10 + 5 which is 15.

The following code accomplishes this, using a running sum variable runsum, and then printing  the overall sum.

```python
runsum = 0 
for i in range(6): 
 runsum = runsum + i 
print('The sum is', runsum)
```
```
The sum is 15
```

As the iterator variable i iterates through the values 0 through 5, each is added to the result  that has already been stored in runsum. The action of the loop is simply to add to the running  sum. Printing is only done after the loop, when the overall sum has been calculated.

In another example, the user is prompted for 4 numbers. Each of the numbers that the user  enters is added to a running sum.

```python
runsum = 0 
for i in range(4): 
 num = float(input('Enter a number: '))  
 runsum = runsum + num 
print('The sum is', runsum)
```
```
Enter a number: 33
Enter a number: 4.5
Enter a number: -5
Enter a number: 2.8
The sum is 35.3
```

In this case, instead of adding the iterator variable i to the running sum, the numbers that the  user enters into the variable num are added to the running sum.

A running sum can also be calculated from the numbers in a list.

```python
runsum = 0 
for n in [4, 33, 11]: 
 runsum = runsum + n 
print('The sum is', runsum)
```
```
The sum is 48
```

### 4.2 Conditional Loops
#### 4.2.1 While and while-else

A loop is a statement that repeats other statement(s), which are called the action of the loop. A  conditional loop repeats the action as long as an expression is True, or until something  happens. In Python, the while statement is used as the conditional loop. The general form is:

```python
while expression:
    action
# rest of code
```

The while loop begins by evaluating the expression (which is also sometimes called the  condition). If the expression is True, then the action is executed. So far, that is exactly like an if statement! But, after the action has been executed in its entirety, control goes back to the top  of the loop, and the expression is evaluated again. If the expression is True this time, the action  is executed again. Then, the expression is evaluated, and if it is True, the action is executed  again. This continues as long as the expression is True. When the expression becomes False, the  while loop ends and control goes to the rest of the code after the while loop. Just like selection  statements and the for loop, the action can consist of any number of statements, which must  be indented to the same level (typically 4 spaces).

For example, the while loop

```python
x = 2 
while x < 5: 
 x = x + 1 
 print(x) 
print('!')
```

would result in this output:

```
3
4
5
!
```

To begin with, the value of the variable x is 2, which is less than 5. So, the action is executed  which increments x to get the value of 3, and this (3) is printed. 3 is less than 5, so the action is  executed again, incrementing x to get the value of 4, and printing 4. 4 is still less than 5, so the  action is executed again, incrementing x to get the value of 5, and printing 5. Then, when the  expression is evaluated, 5 is not less than 5 so the expression is False and the while loop ends.  The statement that prints '!' is after the loop, so it only executes once. Note that in this  example the two statements in the action are indented 4 spaces.

Since the expression is always evaluated before the action in a while loop, it is possible that the  action will not be executed at all. This could occur if the expression is False the first time that it  is evaluated. The code

```python
x = 20 
while x < 5: 
 x = x + 1 
 print(x) 
print('!')
```

would result in this output:

```
!
```

Since 20 is not less than 5, the action of the loop is skipped and the code just prints '!'.

It is important that the action must change something in the expression so that eventually it  becomes False. If this never happens, an infinite loop occurs. To exit from an infinite loop, hit  Control-C in Windows or Linux, or Command-C on Macs for most Python environments. Others  may be different; for example, in Jupyter notebooks it is necessary to choose Kernel and then  Interrupt, or hit the square “interrupt the kernel” icon.

An optional else clause can be added to a while loop, which specifies an action to be executed  when the condition becomes False. The general form is

```python
while expression:
    whileaction
else:
    elseaction
# rest of code
```

For example, we could print the value of x that ends the action of the while loop:

```python
x = 2 
while x < 5: 
 x = x + 1 
 print(x) 
else: 
 print('We are done at ', x) print('!')
```
```
3
4
5
We are done at 5
!
```

The else clause only works if the condition becomes False. Any other method of ending the  loop would not result in the execution of the else clause.

As we have seen, the random function returns a random real number in the range from 0 to 1,  not including 1. As another example, we could use a while loop to print random real numbers  as long as they are less than 0.5.

```python
from random import random 
rf = random() 
while rf < 0.5: 
 print(f'{rf:.2f}') 
 rf = random() 
print('And that is it!')
```
```
0.37
0.22
And that is it!
```

The else clause could be used to print the random number that ended the loop. 

#### 4.2.2 Error Checking

When there is user input into a program, there is almost always a valid range of values. For  example, if the user is prompted to enter the length of the sides of a square, the user should  enter a positive number. There might be a tighter range than that; for example, it may be  specified that the sides should be in the range from 5 to 7 meters. Error-checking means  checking the user’s entry for errors. More specifically, error-checking generally involves  continuing to prompt the user and read in the user’s entry until a valid value is entered. In  Python, this can be accomplished using a while loop.

For example, the following code prompts the user for a positive number, and loops to continue  prompting the user until the user does enter a positive number. For now, we will assume that  the user enters a number, although we will see functions in Chapter 5 that will allow us to  check to make sure that the user in fact entered a number.

```python
number = input('Enter a positive number: ') 
number = float(number) 
while (number <= 0): 
 number = input('Seriously! Enter a positive number: ') 
number = float(number) 
print('Thanks for entering', number)
```

Running the code might result in the following.
```
Enter a positive number: -5
Seriously! Enter a positive number: -11.1
Seriously! Enter a positive number: 3
Thanks for entering 3.0
```

The user was prompted for a positive number, but entered -5. Since the input function returns  a string, the user’s input is cast to the type float. Since that was a negative number (less than or  equal to 0), the action of the loop was executed. In the action, the user was again prompted for  a positive number (‘Seriously!’), but again the user entered a negative number. So, the action
was executed again but this time the user entered 3. Since 3 is not less than or equal to 0, the  False condition causes the loop to cease executing. The code after the loop then printed the  positive number that the user finally entered. Notice that prompting the user is repeated  before the loop, and also in the action of the loop. This is so that there will be a new value of  number every time the condition is evaluated.

Of course, it is possible that the user will follow instructions the first time and enter a positive  number. In that case, running the code might result in the following.
```
Enter a positive number: 5.2
Thanks for entering 5.2
```
Since the condition is evaluated at the top of the loop, and it was already False, the action of  the loop was skipped entirely.

#### 4.2.3 Counting in a while loop

With conditional loops, it is not known ahead of time how many times the action of the loop  will be executed. However, it is often useful to count how many times the action ended up  being executed.

This can be accomplished by creating a counter variable, initializing it before the loop, and  incrementing it by one in the action of the loop (so it is incremented every time the action is  executed). For example, when error-checking we may want to know how many tries it took  before the user entered a correct value.

```python
counter = 0; 
number = input('Enter a positive number: ') 
number = float(number) 
counter = counter + 1 
while (number <= 0): 
 number = input('Seriously! Enter a positive number: ')  
 number = float(number) 
 counter = counter + 1 
print('Thanks for entering', number) 
print('It took you', counter, 'tries.')
```
```
Enter a positive number: -9
Seriously! Enter a positive number: 33 Thanks for entering 33.0
It took you 2 tries.
```

### .3 Nested loops

A nested loop is one loop inside of another. In other words, the action of a loop contains  another loop. Frequently, a nested loop is a nested for loop, in which one for loop is part of the  action of another for loop.

In the following example, a list of words is created. A for loop loops through all of the words,  and then for each word, another for loop loops to print each character followed by a space.

```python
wordlist = ['hello', "hi", 'ciao'] 
for myword in wordlist: 
 for c in myword: 
     print(c, end = ' ') 
     print() 
print("That's it!")
```
```
h e l l o
h i
c i a o
That's it!
```

The first loop is called the outer loop. The action of the outer loop consists of two statements: -  loop to print each character and a space
- a print() to move the cursor down for the next word

The second loop, that loops over the characters, is called the inner loop. The action of the inner  loop is a single print statement. After the nested loop, there is another print statement to print  “That’s it!”. The outer loop iterates over the words in the list. For each word, the inner loop  iterates over the characters in that word.

So, the first time in the outer loop the variable myword will store ‘hello’. The inner loop variable  c will then iterate through all of the characters in the variable myword, and for each it will print  the character and then a space (all on the same line). After the inner loop has completed, the  print() statement will print a newline character, and that is it for the action of the outer loop.  Once this action has completed, the variable myword will store the second string in the list,  “hi”. The inner loop will then iterate through all of its characters and print each one followed by  a space. After both characters have been printed, the print() moves the cursor down to the  next line. Finally, myword gets the value ‘ciao’, and the inner loop prints all of its characters on  one line and then a newline at the end. Once the variable myword has iterated through all 3  words in the list, the outer loop is done so the code prints “That’s it!” after the nested loop has  completed.

The following is an example of a nested loop, in which the outer loop repeats 3 times. Each  time the action is executed, the next integer (0 then 1 then 2) is printed, followed by a colon  and a space. The inner loop then prints, 5 times, a single ‘*’. The second argument, end='',  keeps all of the *’s on the same line and does not print anything between them. The print()
after the inner loop prints the newline character by default, so each of the 3 actions from the  outer loop is on a separate line.

```python
for num in range(3): 
 print(f'{num}:', end=' ')  
 for n in range(5): 
    print('*', end='')  
print()
```
```
0: *****
1: *****
2: *****
```

The outer loop specifies that the action will be repeated 3 times. The action of the outer loop  consists of 3 statements:

- A print statement to print the value of the outer loop variable
- A for loop to repeat the action of printing a single ‘*’ 5 times on the same line • A print statement to move the cursor down for the next value of the outer loop variable
Instead of looping 5 times to print a ‘*’, the following inner loop repeats num times, where num is the value of the outer loop variable (plus 1, so it repeats once, then twice, then three times).

```python
for num in range(3): 
 print(f'{num}:', end=' ')  
 for n in range(num+1):  
    print('*', end='')  
print()
```
```
0: *
1: **
2: ***
```

If instead of printing 0, 1, and 2 in the beginning of the lines, we wanted 1, 2, and 3, the code  would instead look like this:

```python
for num in range(3): 
 print(f'{num+1}:', end=' ')  
 for n in range(num+1):  
    print('*', end='')  
print()
```
```
1: *
2: **
3: ***
```

These were examples of nested for loops. Nested loops can also contain while loops.
For example, let’s say we want the user to enter 3 positive numbers. That means we will use a  for loop to repeat the action 3 times. Each time, we will error-check using a while loop to make  sure that each time a positive number is entered. The algorithm is:

- Loop 3 times
    - Prompt the user for a positive number
    - While the number is not positive
        - Print error message
        - Prompt again
    - Print the positive number

Here is an implementation of the algorithm:

```python
for i in range(3): 
     number = input('Enter a positive number: ')  
    number = float(number) 
    while (number <= 0): 
        print('Please follow directions!')  
        number = input('Enter a positive number: ') 
        number = float(number) 
         print('Thanks for entering', number) 
 print()
```
```
Enter a positive number: 4
Thanks for entering 4.0
Enter a positive number: -3.3
Please follow directions!
Enter a positive number: 5.1
Thanks for entering 5.1
Enter a positive number: -6
Please follow directions!
Enter a positive number: 11
Thanks for entering 11.0
```

An extra print() was added to the action of the outer for loop in order to separate each of the  actions of the for loop.
